// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

Input the first number (num1)                     
 Input the second number (num2)
 Calculate the sum of num1 and num2 (sum = num1 + num2)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

 Input a number (num)
 If num is divisible by 2 (num % 2 == 0), then
  Display "num is even"
 Else
  Display "num is odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


 Initialize sum to 0 (sum = 0)
 Initialize min to a very large value (min = infinity)
 Initialize max to a very small value (max = -infinity)
 Initialize a counter variable i to 1 (i = 1)
 Repeat the following steps 5 times:
     a. Input a number (num)
     b. Add num to sum (sum = sum + num)
     c. If num is less than min, update min to num (if num < min, min = num)
     d. If num is greater than max, update max to num (if num > max, max = num)
     e. Increment i by 1 (i = i + 1)
 Calculate the average as sum divided by 5 (average = sum / 5)
 Display "Average: average"
 Display "Minimum: min"
 Display "Maximum: max"
